# AulaCube Task Manager 
## Description
With all of the essential features for a task management tool, the AulaCube Task Manager app offers a comprehensive task management experience. Users have the ability to rename, add, remove, and arrange their jobs according to projects. A user may modify tasks inside a project in a number of ways, such as by adding new ones, removing existing ones, and managing their titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority. The local storage keeps track of all user modifications, making it possible to maintain work between sessions.


## Main Features
- **Task Management Flexibility:** Give users extensive task management options so they may customise the Todo app to suit their own requirements. In addition to managing projects by adding new ones or deleting old ones, users may mark tasks as completed and update facts about them, such as the due date, description, title, and priority.

- **Local Storage:** Every modification a user makes is recorded by the app in the local storage, so even if they close the browser or a tab, their modifications remain intact. With the help of this feature, all user changes and additions—like starting new projects, adding or removing tasks, changing task data, and designating tasks as finished—are automatically stored to the local storage. Users may keep their work list intact across sessions thanks to this.

- **Responsive Design:** All desktop screen sizes are supported by the app's user-friendly design and consistent user experience. It can accommodate window scaling down to a certain extent, however currently there isn't a layout for a mobile device.
